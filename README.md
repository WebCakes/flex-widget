Simple Image Widget is what the name implies -- the easiest way to add images to sidebars in WordPress. It uses the media manager introduced in WordPress 3.5 to seamlessly uploading and selecting images.

Despite the simplicity, it's been built with extensibility in mind to make it super easy to spin off new image-based widgets with completely different fields. The plugin also includes a basic template hierarchy to load custom templates from a theme or child theme.

## Installation ##

Simple Image Widget is available in the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-image-widget/), so it can be installed from your admin panel like most other plugins.
